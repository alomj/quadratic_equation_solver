# Quadratic Equation Solver

This application solves quadratic equations of the form:
ax² + bx + c = 0
It supports two modes:
1. **Interactive Mode** – Users manually input coefficients.
2. **File Mode** – The program reads coefficients from a file.

## Installation & Usage

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quadratic_solver.git
cd quadratic_solver
```
### Run the project
```bash 
python main.py
```

#### File Format for Non-Interactive Mode
The file for non-interactive mode must contain three numbers separated by spaces. These numbers represent the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Example file content:
```bash
1 -3 2
```

### Revert Commit
To revert to a previous state of the project, use the git revert command. For example:

```bash
git revert <commit_hash>
```
Where <commit_hash> is the hash of the commit you want to revert to.
